## 1. General:

## 1.1 Definitions:

- **DDL** (Data Definition Language) - it is used to define data structures (create table, alter table, ...)

- **DML** (Data Manipulation Language) - it is used to manipulate data itself (insert, update, delete, ...)

- **ETL** (extract, transfer, load) tools - tools for migrating data from storage (e.g. SQL db) to data warehouse (e.g. Hadoop). Examples of ETLs: Spark, Microsoft SSIS, Azure Data Factory, ...

## 1.2 Example Database (SQLite) installation:

1. Download 32bit Precompiled Binaries for Windows (with CLI tools for managing SQLite database files)
2. Unzip into ProgramFiles folder
3. Add sqlite to PATH environment variable
4. Create database: sqlite3 test.db
5. List tables and their schemas : .tables and .schema tableName

## 1.3 Example datasets:

- AdventureWorks - Microsoft sample db with data from a "fictitious, multinational manufacturing company called Adventure Works Cycles"

---

## 2. Commands:

## 2.1 General notes:

- Upper-case - SQL keywords are **NOT case sensitive**: select is the same as SELECT
- Semicolon - **some** database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement
- SQL has **3 main subsets** (definitions in job faq) reflected bu SQL commands. Commands in SQL are devided in few subsets based on type of data transformations:
  - on **database level**: CREATE/ALTER/DELETE DATABASE dbName
  - on **table level** there are commands defining: table modifications, data-types, constrains and views
  - on **data level** there are commands for: selecting, joining, modifing and agregating data
- SQL comments:
  ```sql
  -- one line comment
  /*
      Multiple line comment
  */
  ```
- cannot refer to aliases in WHERE command

### **Alises** - allows you to name columns and tables:

> SELECT **column_name AS alias_name** FROM table_name;

> SELECT column_name(s)
> FROM **table_name AS alias_name**;

Missing coma is also interpreted as alias:

> SELECT column_name(s)
> FROM **table_name alias_name**;

---

## 2.2 Database and Tables:

### Database:

> CREATE/ALTER DATABASE _databaseName_ _options_\*

> DROP DATABASE _databaseName_

### Tables:

> **CREATE TABLE _tableName_ (_data-type_ _constraint_) <br>**
> example:<br> CREATE TABLE testTable (first varchar(10) PRIMARY KEY, second varchar(10) NOT NULL);

> ALTER TABLE _tableName_ ADD/ALTER/DROP COLUMN _name_ _datatype_ _constrain_;

> DROP TABLE _tableName_; <br>
> TRUNCATE TABLE _tableName_;

\* **For more info about data types and constraints see[Datatypes](#Datatypes)**

---

## 2.3 Data selection:

```SQL
SELECT [DISTINCT] [AS]
FROM [AS]
JOIN ON
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY
LIMIT
```

- **SELECT** data **FROM** - obvious

- **DISTINCT** - returns distinct records

  > SELECT **DISTINCT** Country FROM Customers;

- **AS** - alias for columns and tables (described in [General Notes](#general-notes))

- **HAVING/WHERE**:<br>
  **WHERE** is used to filter records before any groupings take place.<br>
  **HAVING** is used to filter values after they have been groups.  
  **\*!** Only columns or expression in the GROUP BY can be included in the HAVING clauseâ€™s conditions. **!\***

  WHERE/HAVING **operators**:

  - **=, <, >,**
  - **LIKE** - with LIKE you can use 'wildcard'operators: % and _(? in MS SQL); % means 'somecharacters', _ means 'one character' - so'a%o\_' means 'string that starts with a, nextcontains some unspecified characters and endswith 'o' followed by a unspecified character'
  - **AND, OR, NOT, IS NULL**
  - **BETWEEN .. AND ...** - also strings: BETWEEN'A' AND 'Z'
  - **IN ()** - to specify multiple possiblevalues for a column: WHERE country IN('Poland', 'Germany', 'UK')

  Operators for subqueries:

  - **EXISTS** - used with subqueries (only with WHERE) - checks returns true if the subquery returns one or more records
    > SELECT \* FROM table WHERE **EXISTS** (SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition);
  - **ANY** and **ALL** - allow to perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values (all with all)

    > SELECT \* FROM table WHERE column operator **ANY/ALL** (SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition);

    > SELECT \* FROM table WHERE id > **ANY/ALL** (SELECT id FROM table WHERE id > 10);

- **ORDER BY**: > SELECT \_ FROM table **ORDER BY** columns;

  > SELECT \_ FROM Customers **ORDER BY** Country, CustomerName;
  > ORDER BY has 2 operators: ASC and DECS.

- **LIMIT/TOP**:

  > SELECT columns FROM table WHERE condition **LIMIT** number;<br>
  > SELECT \* FROM Customers LIMIT 3;

  for MS SQL:

  > SELECT **TOP** number columns FROM table WHERE condition;<br>
  > SELECT TOP 3 \* FROM Customers;

- **UNION**:

      The UNION operator is used to combine the result of two or more SELECT statements.

  Each SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns with the same data types
  (e.g. SELECT(1) with 3 columns: int, varchar, varchar // SELECT(2) with 3 columns: int, varchar, varchar)

  ````SQL
  SELECT columns FROM table1 WHERE ...
  **UNION**
  SELECT columns FROM table2 WHERE ...

      /*
      result:
      someNumber1
      someNumber1
      someNumber2
      someNumber2
      */
      ```

      **\*** you can also query for UNION ALL (which means 'union all columns') - but it has to meet requirements about numer and type of columns

  ````

- **CAST** and **ROUND**:

  > **CAST**(number AS **dataType**)<br> > **ROUND**(number, **decimalPlaces**)

  > CAST(ROUND(1/15, 2) AS FLOAT)

## 2.4 Data Modification

- **INSERT** **INTO** table (columns...) **VALUES** (values...)

  ```SQL
  INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country) VALUES  ('Cardinal', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');
  ```

- **UPDATE** table **SET** column1 = value1, column2 = value2, **WHERE** condition;

  ```SQL
  UPDATE Customers SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City=  'Frankfurt' WHERE CustomerID = 1;
  ```

- **DELETE** **FROM** table **WHERE** condition;
  DELETE is like SELECT ? E.G. CAN I LIMIT DETELE? Check it!
  ```SQL
  DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';
  ```
  To truncate table just ignore WHERE:
  ```SQL
  DELETE FROM Customers
  ```

## 2.5 Joins

**Joins** - in JOIN there **SHOULD** be foreign key (is there is not it means that there is a mistake)

## 2.6 Agregation Functions

**SQL Aggregate Functions** - return a single value, calculated from values in a column:

```
COUNT() - Returns the number of rows
SUM() - Returns the sum
FIRST() - Returns the first value
LAST() - Returns the last value
MAX() - Returns the largest value
MIN() - Returns the smallest value
AVG() - Returns the average value
```

**SQL Scalar functions** - return a single value, based on the input value. 3 main categories are:

- strings (UCASE() - _uppercase_, LCASE(), LEN()...)
- numbers (ROUND(), COS()...)
- dates (e. g. NOW(), YEAR(), DAY()...)

---

## 2.7 Indexes:

Indexes may be added a specifict column to speed up queries.
When created they order column records (this order is seen only from db perspective), which helps when searching for data - it is easier to find data in ordered list.

> **CREATE INDEX** columnName **ON** tableName<br> > **DROP INDEX** columnName

---

## 2.8 Views:

CREATE VIEW creates virtual table which contains data specified in SELECT query - its something like predefined SELECT:

```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW viewName AS
SELECT...

DROP VIEW viewName
```

---

## 2.9 Transactions:

## 2.10 Subqueries & Stored procedures & Views & Functions & CTE:

2.11 Database functions:
CASE:

```SQL
SELECT name,
    CASE
        WHEN clan = '' THEN 'undefined'
        ELSE clan
    END
FROM ...
```

ROW_NUMBER():

```SQL
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(points) DESC)
```

EXAMPLE:

```
SELECT
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(points) DESC) as rank,
  SUM(points) as total_points,
  COUNT(name) as total_people,
  CASE
    WHEN clan = '' THEN '[no clan specified]'
    ELSE clan
  END
FROM people
GROUP BY clan
ORDER BY rank ASC
```

## 3. Datatypes and constraints:

| Type                                          | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| boolean                                       | Stores TRUE or FALSE values. In some databases boolean is replaced with bit/byte or int                                                                                                                                                                        |
| int/integer(p) (or integer, smallint, bigint) | Integer numerical (no decimal).

Max 255 bytes. 50% faster than varchar. |
| varchar(size)                                 | Variable-length character string. It always takes number of characters in database equal to its length . Max size is specified in parenthesis. Slower than char.                                                                                               |
| number(size)                                  | Number value with a max number of column digits specified in parenthesis.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| date                                          | Date value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| number(size,d)                                | Number value with a maximum number of digits of "size" total, with a maximum number of "d" digits to the right of the decimal.                                                                                                                                 |
| xml                                           | Stores xml data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Constraints

| Constraint  | Description                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NOT NULL    | Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value                                                                        |
